Our mission is to protect public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. Every day, DEP delivers more than 1 billion gallons of the highest quality drinking water to nine million New Yorkers, and treats more than 1.3 gallons of wastewater to protect the environment and the NYCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surrounding waterways. DEPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision is to be the safest, most efficient, cost-effective, resilient, and transparent water utility in the nation.  The values we embrace in performing our day-to-day work are safety, service, support, transparency, innovation, diversity and sustainability.    We are seeking to fill the position of Deputy Commissioner (DC) of the Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO). This position oversees the maintenance and operation of DEPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive water, sewer and drainage systems, which deliver and collect water through 7,000 miles of water mains and 7,400 miles of sewers. The Bureau is often referred to as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillboardÃ¢â‚¬Â of DEP, because its 1,200 employees regularly interface with NYC citizens on streets and in communities throughout the five boroughs. Bureau staff respond 24 hours per day, 7 days a week to calls made to the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 3-1-1 Call Center on issues related to water and sewer services. Response times and the quality of solutions are key measures in the MayorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Monthly Management Report.   The Bureau is also responsible for maintaining more than 109,000 fire hydrants and 148,000 catch basins.  In addition, the Bureau contributes to improving storm water management in NYC through our Green Infrastructure Program by maintaining thousands of curbside rain gardens, referred to as bioswales. This responsibility requires the Bureau to manage the growth of green jobs, which are expected to provide employment and career opportunities to NYC citizens, especially in disadvantaged communities.   An important component of the BWSO DC position is providing leadership and policy direction to the bureauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staff of managers, engineers, construction laborers, and other operations personnel.

Background  NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission is to increase opportunities for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers by providing safe, affordable housing and facilitating access to social and community services.  Almost 400,000 New Yorkers reside in NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 325 public housing developments around the five boroughs, and another 235,000 receive subsidized rental assistance in private homes through the NYCHA-administered Section 8 Leased Housing Program.  In 2016 NYCHA released the NextGeneration NYCHA Sustainability Agenda, the AuthorityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 10-year plan to improve energy efficiency and shrink NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carbon footprint, and create healthy and comfortable homes that will withstand the challenge of climate change.  For more information, visit j.mp/green-nycha.   NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work on clean and renewable energy is anchored by its commitment to site 25MW of renewables at NYCHA by 2026, a part of the HUD Renew300 program (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/renewable-energy/).  NYCHA began implementation toward this goal by releasing the first large-scale solar RFP in 2017 with a goal of securing third-party solar development for up to 6MW, to be implemented as community shared solar projects (http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/about/press/pr-2017/solar-20171013.page).  NYCHA is also developing a parallel program targeting small-building solar to encourage direct involvement of small businesses and non-profits from NYCHA communities.  NYCHA seeks a Program Manager with a passion for sustainability to lead NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s portfolio of clean, renewable, and distributed energy initiatives.  Reporting to the Director for Sustainability Programs, the Program Manager will oversee NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s progress toward meeting its commitment to site 25MW of renewable energy capacity at NYCHA developments, and serve as the in-house point person on clean energy policy ranging from VDER to clean fleets.  These projects are complex technically, legally, politically and financially, and require a staff person who has both technical background, program management and relationship building skills.   Responsibilities  The Program Manager will manage one staff person and several teams of consultants.  1.Manage and develop clean and renewable energy programs (50%):  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Manage the series of large-scale commercial solar projects from pipeline development and Request for Proposals, through contacts negotiations, and construction and commissioning; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Develop and manage the small buildings solar program targeting direct participation of small businesses and non-profit organizations in NYCHA communities; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Manage internal and external relationships to facilitate beneficial and efficient progress on the above initiatives, ensuring timely and mutually beneficial communication between project stakeholders; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Monitor relevant policy discussions and developments at the local, state, and federal levels (e.g. developments in VDER); create and track progress against project schedules, budgets, and program pipelines; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Assess and identify problems accurately and in a timely manner, evaluate and recommend solutions with realistic objectives and time frames;  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Monitor other (non-solar) clean, renewable, and distributed energy developments in the field, including those related to distributed storage and clean fleet, with an eye to when and how NYCHA should evaluate active participation.   2.Manage NYCHA participation in the NYC clean energy community of practice (30%):  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Forge and maintain inter-agency relationships (the MayorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Office Sustainability, Department of Citywide Administrative Services, City University of New York) and ensure NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interests are represented in city-wide program and policy development; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Forge and maintain clean energy industry relationships including with utilities, industry associations, and solar developers to foster interest and support of NYCYAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clean and renewable energy programs; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Represent NYCHA at external conferences, networking events, and other public forums to elevate NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s profile on clean energy in the industry;  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Proactively support NYCHA's Department of Communications and Intergovernmental Relations Department to promote NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s progress on clean, renewable, and distributed energy in the media and among elected officials.  3.Support Sustainability Programs DepartmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role as an in-house consultancy (20%):  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Provide programmatic support as directed for other initiatives of the Sustainability Programs Department, including coordinating and documenting early-stage program development for multi-hazard climate resilience.","1.

Background  NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission is to increase opportunities for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers by providing safe, affordable housing and facilitating access to social and community services.  Almost 400,000 New Yorkers reside in NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 325 public housing developments around the five boroughs, and another 235,000 receive subsidized rental assistance in private homes through the NYCHA-administered Section 8 Leased Housing Program.  In 2016 NYCHA released the NextGeneration NYCHA Sustainability Agenda, the AuthorityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 10-year plan to improve energy efficiency and shrink NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carbon footprint, and create healthy and comfortable homes that will withstand the challenge of climate change.  For more information, visit j.mp/green-nycha.   NYCHAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work on clean and renewable energy is anchored by its commitment to site 25MW of renewables at NYCHA by 2026, a part of the HUD Renew300 program (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/renewable-energy/).  NYCHA began implementation toward this goal by releasing the first large-scale solar RFP in 2017 with a goal of securing third-party solar development for up to 6MW, to be implemented as community shared solar projects (http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/about/press/pr-2017/solar-20171013.page).
